# Assembly-Composite-Numbers #
MASM Assembly program to calculate and display composite numbers.

## Objectives ##
1) Designing and implementing procedures.
2) Designing and implementing loops.
3) Writing nested loops.
4) Understanding data validation.

## Description ##
* The user enters the number of composites to be displayed within a range of 1 to 400.
* When the user enters a number x the program validates that 0 < x < 401.
* Then the program calculates and displays all of the composite numbers.
* The results are displayed 10 composites per line with at least 3 spaces between the numbers.
